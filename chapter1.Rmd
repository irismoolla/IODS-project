# About the project

Actually, this is my third time I am trying to complete this course. I feel like the contents of this course would be extremely useful for my studies and I am very excited about the course and that is the reason why I have wanted to go through with it. The course just happens to happen at the time of the year when my schedule is the craziest and I have had to drop out a couple of times. I really hope I will have time and energy to complete the course this time!
